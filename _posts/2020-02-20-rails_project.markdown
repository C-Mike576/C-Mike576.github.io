The idea for my rails project was a place for game masters and players of tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons to gather and trade notes between each other. Unfortunately due to illness putting me out of commission for almost 2 weeks I was forced to simplify. Compared to my Sinatra project Rails is so much more enjoyable to work with. The Rails app structure was very intuitive to get the hang of.

# Where I Ended Up

My project ended up being only game masters able to send notes to players. The app still includes user sign up, sign in, log out. The app also includes a sign up/ sign in through google. While working through my project everything went fairly smoothly. The project really highlights the different parts I’ve learned over the past few months and how it all comes together.

# What I Would Change

I would like to revisit this project after I’ve finished this program. I would make another join table to include game masters and players into play groups so that users could keep track of other users that are in their actual real life play groups. Game masters might even be able to keep track of campaign notes and details through the app.
